# SmartPersonalFinanceAndCreditCardManagementSystem

Managing personal finances has become increasingly complex due to multiple income sources, frequent digital payments, and the use of multiple credit cards. Many individuals fail to track daily expenses properly and often miss credit card due dates, resulting in late fees and poor financial planning. Existing finance applications are either too complex or lack transparency and user control.

This project aims to build a simple, secure, and user-friendly personal finance management system that allows users to track income and expenses, manage credit cards, and monitor credit card dues in one unified platform.
